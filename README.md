## P1: Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project, I wrote a Python script to create an interactive exprience in the terminal to present statistics for US Bikeshare Data in three major cities. Through the interactive exprience, user would get summary statistics of bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, or Washington.
