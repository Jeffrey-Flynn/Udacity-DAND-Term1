# P0: Explore Weather Trends
## Overview
In this project, I analyzed Taipei and global temperature data and compared their temperature trends. It includes three parts:
* **Extract the data**: Using the basic SQL query to find the city nearest to me and extract the city level data in the database. And also extract the global data.
* **Calculate the temperature statistics and visualize the trends**: Using Excel tool to calculate the moving average for Taipei and global, and plot the line charts for each.
* **Analyze the trends**: Observe the trends and make observations about the similarities and differences on the trends.
