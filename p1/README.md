# P1: Explore US Bikeshare Data
## Overview
In this project, I write a Python script to create an interactive exprience in the terminal to present statistics for US Bikeshare Data in three major cities.
Through the interactive exprience, user can get summary statistics of bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, or Washington. The statistics include: top 3 common birth year of users, top 3 popular start station, etc. For more statistics details, see [Statistics Computed](#statistics-computed).
The data time period is the first six months of 2017, user can filter data by month, week day of week, or just investigate all duration.
## Installation and Requirements
- Python v3.6 or later.
- Download all three [data files](https://github.com/onpillow/Udacity-DAND-Term1/tree/master/p1/bikeshare_rawdata), be sure to include the raw data `chicago.csv`,
`new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`.
- Download `bike_share.py` file from the [repo](https://github.com/onpillow/Udacity-DAND-Term1/tree/master/p1), and put it with `chicago.csv`,`new_york_city.csv`,`washington.csv`in the same folder.
- Run `bike_share.py` file from my repo.
